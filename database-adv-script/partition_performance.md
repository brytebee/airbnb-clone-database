PARTITIONING PERFORMANCE REPORT
================================

Test Environment:
- Table: Booking_Partitioned
- Partitioning Strategy: RANGE by start_date (monthly)
- Number of Partitions: 25 (24 months + future)
- Test Data Size: [Insert actual data size]

Performance Improvements Observed:

1. Date Range Queries:
   - Before Partitioning: [X] seconds
   - After Partitioning: [Y] seconds
   - Improvement: [Z]% faster

2. Partition Pruning:
   - Single month queries now scan only 1 partition instead of entire table
   - 3-month range queries scan only 3 partitions

3. Maintenance Operations:
   - Old data can be dropped by partition (faster than DELETE)
   - New partitions can be added without affecting existing data

4. Index Performance:
   - Indexes are smaller per partition
   - Query planning is more efficient

Recommendations:
- Monitor partition sizes and adjust strategy if needed
- Implement automated partition maintenance
- Consider sub-partitioning for extremely large datasets
